                            <p>My name is Andres Menjivar. I am 19 years old and a second year student at The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Prior to attending Chapel Hill, I was a student at Hugh M. Cummings High School and was the top student of my class, graduating with a 5.0313 grade point average. I have done many extracurricular activities including All County Orchestra, Student Advisory Council, Student Government Association, and College Ambassadors. Of these, playing the cello was my passion. I enjoyed many genres of music, and having played the cello for 6 years, music continues to be a major aspect of my life outside of academics. In School, I was highly gifted in Mathematics and Natural Sciences. I was often recognized by peers, tutors, and teachers. My senior year of High School, I received the Times News Award of Excellence for Science. Overall, I am a very exceptional student and hope my work represents this.</p>
